        <p>Water is yet another infrastructure that we pay very little attention to though we use it everyday.
        In many ways the structure required to get this water to us is very similar to the structure required to get electricity to us.
        Both have to be brought into areas wear people live from a sorce and in both these examples the electricity and the water move underground and into peoples homes. </p>

                <h3>Drain</h3>
                <p>One of the interesting aspects about our water infrastructure is that not only is a system required to deliver water to us, one is also required to take water away from us.
                This is an example of one of the many drains throughout the cityput in place to remove unwanted water.</p>
