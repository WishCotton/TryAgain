            In cities everything is electrafied and the paths those currents take can be seen all around us.
            In much of Wellington wires run underground and connect to electrical boxes that can be seen on the sides of buildings.
            From there the wires go through pipes and tubes up the sides of buildings and into peoples homes.
            Once there we can all acsess this power using the power outlets on our walls.
