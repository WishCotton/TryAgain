            Both water and power are brought to us in a simple yet frequently over looked system.
            They are both comodities that have to be brought into peoples living spaces from a larger sorce.
            Both are transported underground and into homes where they can be used for our everyday needs.
            The internet is much the same but we dont think of it that way because it feels less tangable.
            The internet is just another utility that has to be brought to places where people live and into their homes so they can access it.

        This is a drawing I did of a map I found of the New Zealand power grid.
        There is only a map of ubove ground structures and I found that to get information about below ground structures you actually have to send in a request.
        Another odd thing is they provide this map with these color coded lines but they do not actually explain what any of the color coding means or even what the lines are supposed to represent.
        Apparently all of New Zealands power grid is owned and operated by Transpower, which is state owned.
        I will provide a link to there website and to the original map below.

        Wellington City Council actually provides quite a lot of information about their water policy and about Wellingtons water systems.
        Unfortunately I could not find any actual maps aside from the one of where water works are taking place.
